      <h1>Android Colors</h1>
      <p>Android uses hexadecimal ARGB values, which are formatted as #AARRGGBB. The AA, represent the alpha channel. During UI design sometimes you want to add alpha channel(Opacity) to your colors. Instead of doing Math here is quick list for you referencing needs.If you want to do the math:
<hr>

<ol class="list_hexConversion">
  <li>Take your opacity as a decimal value and multiply it by 255. So, if you have a block that is 50% opaque the decimal value would be .5. For example: .5 x 255 = 127.5</li>
  <li>The fraction wonâ€™t convert to hexadecimal, so you must round your number up or down to the nearest whole number. For example: 127.5 rounds up to 128; 55.25 rounds down to 55.</li>
  <li>Enter your decimal value in a decimal-to-hexadecimal converter, like http://www.binaryhexconverter.com/decimal-to-hex-converter, and convert your values.Add a zero if you get back a single value.</li>

</ol>

    <p>Google makes this very easy if you follow their guide or this one all you need is to Create Multiple apps within one Firebase Project this way you can name you projects similar you.project.name & you.project.name.debug following this pattern and modifying you Gradel build file for release and debug config will allow you to quickly switch between testing you analytic changes and configuring new Firebase values</p>
